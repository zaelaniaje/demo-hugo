Configuration Directory
In addition to using a single site config file, one can use the configDir directory (default to config/) to maintain easier organization and environment specific setting 

Each file represents a configuration root object, such as Params, Menus, language etc.
Each directory held a groups of files containing setting unique to an environment. 
Files can be localized to become language specific.
